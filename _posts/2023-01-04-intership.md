We rented a room on Liman 3 Novi Sad, intended for the training of programmers
so that they improve their knowledge to the level that they can start working on
client jobs.
It will be an unpaid one-month internship (February) for the Ruby on Rails
platform, 4+ hours every weekday.

Requirements:
- experience with `git`, `HTML&CSS`, `Ruby on Rails`, `SQL` (bonus if you are
  using `vim`, develop with `testing` approach)
- self motivated hobby projects (web, linux, electronics or similar)
- good communication skills, knowledge sharing, honesty (nice person)
- dedicated to a healthy lifestyle, practicing recreational sport (for example walking)

Benefits:
- 1 hour a day of mentoring and setting tasks (`jekyll`, `Rails`)
- work on our open source projects like Movebase.link (listing of sport events)
- learn linux secrets on Ubuntu Multiseat computer
- joint morning trainings (walking, paddling a SUP board)

We select participants based on our assessment of whether they are ready to
master Ruby on Rails material during the internship.

We hope that at the end of the internship participants will be ready enough to
apply for client jobs.

Send an application to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a> with a short description of what you
have done so far, your github profile and eventually what do you expect from the
intership from our side (so we can see if we are a good fit for you).
